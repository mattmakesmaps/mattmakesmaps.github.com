			"content_html": "<p>I've rebuilt this site using the <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a> static site generator.</p>\n<p>The previous version ran on <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">jekyll</a>, whoose out-of-the-box integration\nwith <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> felt revolutionary when I made the switch\nfrom WordPress years ago.</p>\n<p>This site is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog\">eleventy-base-blog</a> template\n(which appears to be an official release).</p>\n<p>Source files are hosted on the <a href=\"https://github.com/mattmakesmaps/mattmakesmaps.github.com\">mattmakesmaps.github.com</a>\nproject repo's <code>master</code> branch, with <a href=\"https://github.com/mattmakesmaps/mattmakesmaps.github.com/actions/runs/6556377877\">github actions</a>\nused to build and deploy content from the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. At Tableau, I used Travis CI and JetBrains' TeamCity for builds, and getting started with Github Actions felt very similar.</p>\n<p>With the old Jekyll content also being markdown entries, I'll be able to migrate as much or as\nlittle of my old content as I choose over the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of a Github Actions run deploying the site. 35s for a free build\n(since the repo is public) is perfect for my purposes.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://mattmakesmaps.com/img/q4kJHwBnN7-320.webp 320w, https://mattmakesmaps.com/img/q4kJHwBnN7-600.webp 600w\" sizes=\"90vw, (min-width: 1280px) 1156px\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://mattmakesmaps.com/img/q4kJHwBnN7-320.jpeg 320w, https://mattmakesmaps.com/img/q4kJHwBnN7-600.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"90vw, (min-width: 1280px) 1156px\"><img alt=\"Screenshot showing the github actions build pipeline. Total runtime is 35 seconds.\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://mattmakesmaps.com/img/q4kJHwBnN7-320.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"646\"></picture></p>\n<p>With regards to images, I wasn't familiar with the current standard\n<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp\">webp format</a> nor the best practice of generating multiple sized\nversions of each image, optimizing loading performance across a variety of potential screen sizes.\nThe latter is refered as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images\">responsive images</a>.</p>\n<p>The Eleventy framework handles this well out-of-the-box, allowing you generate custom export functions\nthat handle all aspects of output resolution and formats. I found the following to be a\ngreat tutorial: <a href=\"https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/eleventy-image-plugin/\">https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/eleventy-image-plugin/</a></p>\n",
