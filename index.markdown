**Hello :wave:** - My name is Matt Kenny, and I'm interested in mapping technologies.

I'm taking time off work to recover after caring for my mom through brain cancer, dementia, and hospice.

I most recently spent nine years as an engineer on the Maps team at Tableau Software in Seattle, WA.

Prior to that, I was a cartographer and analyst working with Tribal governments in Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and the American Southwest.

Feel free to learn more about me (and say "Hello") using the social links below.
