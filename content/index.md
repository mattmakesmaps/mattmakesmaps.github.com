Hello ðŸ‘‹ - My name is Matt Kenny, and Iâ€™m interested in mapping technologies,
woodworking, and growing with my amazing wife and twin sons.

At the end of 2024 I started a new role as a GIS Data Engineer for
**[The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/)**.
I'm coming back after a career break, which allowed me to recover after caring
for my mom through brain cancer, dementia, and hospice for a number of years.

I worked for nine years as a GIS Data Engineer and later Software Engineer
on the Maps team at **[Tableau Software](https://www.tableau.com/)** in Seattle, WA.

Prior to that, I worked as a cartographer and Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) analyst working with Tribal governments in Washington, Oregon,
Alaska, and the American Southwest at **[RIDOLFI](https://www.ridolfi.com/)**.

Interested in blues music or community radio? Check out a weekly radio show
I produced in 2022-2023, **["Rollin With the Blues"](https://kvru.org/programs/rollin-with-the-blues/)**,
hosted by Seattle blues musician CT Thompson on **[KVRU 105.7 LPFM](https://kvru.org/)**
in Seattle's Rainier Valley. Monday and Friday evenings at 8PM.
