title: OpenStreetMap.org Mapping Party This Weekend
---

[http://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Phoenix/](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Phoenix/) It's going to rock. It really is.

Having just heard of OSM a little over a month ago, and using their tiles for about two weeks now... I'm really excited to give back to the OSM community. In a way, it's a chance for those who have never committed code to a FOSS project (like me) to really add some positive input back <!-- more --> into a community that we are a part of, if only in a small way. But hey, if we are all contributing small bits to the project-at-large... it'll add up. A little '[neogeography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neogeography)', anyone?

Additionally, I have put together a small tool to compare the current OSM offerings to that of various commercial mapping vendors (Google, Microsoft VE). Pretty fun exploration of the OpenLayers API!
