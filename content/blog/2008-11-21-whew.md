Calling Mapserver as a WFS layer, displaying with OpenLayers. Many thanks to [Chris Schmidt](http://crschmidt.net/) for a quick response on the OL mailing list! <!-- more -->

Currently set to extract attributes in the OL html, but still need to build in the attribute display. A good example of the necessary javascript can be found in the [OL Cookbook](http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/openmnnd.html).

I also set a quick thank you to Jeff McKenna at [Gateway Geomatics](http://www.gatewaygeomatics.com/ ) for putting together such a great set of UMN Mapserver WFS and WMS tutorials. He actually wrote back! oh FOSS4G, what a nice community.
