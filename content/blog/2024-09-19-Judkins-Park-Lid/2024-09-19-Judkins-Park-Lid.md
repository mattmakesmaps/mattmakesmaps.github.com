## Overview

I've lived in the Judkins Park neighborhood of Seattle for the last ten years. 

The City's own [Neighborhood Map Atlas](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b4a142f592e94d39a3bf787f3c112c1d/explore?location=47.585811%2C-122.294092%2C14.47) lists the primary name of this neighborhood as `Atlantic` with `Judkins Park` as an alternative name among `Colman` and `Jackson Place`. I've also thought of this neighborhood as the south end of the Central District.

Interstate 90 runs beneath this neighborhood, encapsulated for a length of 3,300 feet according to the
Mount Baker Tunnel [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Baker_Tunnel). The eastern half
of that tunnel has existed since 1940 (according to the previously linked wikipedia article). The western
half however was exposed, and covered as part of the creation of a "lid" that developed Sam Smith Park,
Jimi Hendrix Park, and the opening of the (potentially soon to be shuttered)
Thurgood Marshall Elementary School.

**I-90 West and East Tunnel Entrances.**

Note the layout of I-90 in the image below. The West and East tunnel entrances can be seen on either
side. `23rd Ave S` is visible as the western most street running North/South. 
`Martin Luther King Jr Way S` (Formerly `Empire Way`) is visible bisecting Sam Smith Park to the East
and Thurgood Marshall Elementary/Jimi Hendrix Park/Northwest African American Museum to the West.

The area in red indicates the rough location of The Lid, as seen in higher detail below.
