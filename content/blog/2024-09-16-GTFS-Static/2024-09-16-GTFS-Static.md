In Seattle Washington, we're blessed with great multimodal transit, as well apps and
open data to help us get around as efficiently as possible.

Both static (schedule) data and realtime locations of transit vehicles (light right/bus
/street car/etc) can be found in the [OneBusAway](https://onebusaway.org/) app, which
originally started in the Puget Sound Region. One of the powerful elements of the OBA app is
that it ties together information for [multiple regional transit agencies](https://www.soundtransit.org/help-contacts/business-information/open-transit-data-otd/otd-downloads) in a single interface.

This post will focus on the static schedule data, and later posts hopefully will cover my exploration on the realtime data offered up both by the OneBusAway API and some of the agency specific data hosts.

Static scheduling data that power OneBusAway are generated by regional transit agencies in the General Transit Feed Specification or GTFS format, originally developed by [Google](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs) in 2006 with an interesting tie-in to [Portland's TriMet transit agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTFS#History)

Each Puget Sound regional transit agency's GTFS schedules can be found at the following page, as a formatted set of zipped text files conforming to the GTFS standard: [https://www.soundtransit.org/help-contacts/business-information/open-transit-data-otd/otd-downloads](https://www.soundtransit.org/help-contacts/business-information/open-transit-data-otd/otd-downloads)
