In Seattle Washington, we're blessed with great multimodal transit, as well apps and
open data to help us get around as efficiently as possible.

Both static (schedule) data and realtime locations of transit vehicles (light right/bus
/street car/etc) can be found in the [OneBusAway](https://onebusaway.org/) app, which
originally started in the Puget Sound Region. One of the powerful elements of the OBA app is
that it ties together information for [multiple regional transit agencies](https://www.soundtransit.org/help-contacts/business-information/open-transit-data-otd/otd-downloads) in a single interface.

This post will focus on the static schedule data, and later posts hopefully will cover my exploration on the realtime data offered up both by the OneBusAway API and some of the agency specific data hosts.

Static scheduling data that power OneBusAway are generated by regional transit agencies in the General Transit Feed Specification or GTFS format, originally developed by [Google](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs) in 2006 with an interesting tie-in to [Portland's TriMet transit agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTFS#History)

Each Puget Sound regional transit agency's GTFS schedules can be found at the following page, as a formatted set of zipped text files conforming to the GTFS standard: [https://www.soundtransit.org/help-contacts/business-information/open-transit-data-otd/otd-downloads](https://www.soundtransit.org/help-contacts/business-information/open-transit-data-otd/otd-downloads)

## Data Overview

Let's take a look at the [King County Metro GTFS Export](https://www.soundtransit.org/GTFS-KCM/google_transit.zip) to better understand what we're dealing with.

```
matthewkenny@Matthews-MacBook-Pro kc_metro % wc -l *
       4 agency.txt
      62 calendar.txt
    3300 calendar_dates.txt
      12 fare_attributes.txt
      59 fare_rules.txt
       1 feed_info.txt
     151 routes.txt
  234853 shapes.txt
 1978415 stop_times.txt
    6600 stops.txt
   56500 trips.txt
 2279957 total
```

The full data dictionary for each of the above text files can be found at the
[gtfs.org reference webpage](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/).
This reference doc outlines which files are required/optional and within those files,
fields themselves that are required/optional.

Let's follow [King County Metro Route 8](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/routes-and-service/schedules-and-maps/008) in these data files. Route 8 happens to weave its way by my house in Seattle's Central District, through the dense neighborhood of Capitol Hill, past the Amazon HQ in South Lake Union, and ends all the way at the Space Needle and my personal favorite destination, the KEXP cafe an gathering space.

This route is identified in these data using a unique `route_id` value (`100275`) found in `routes.txt`.
See below for an example from `routes.txt`.

```
route_id,agency_id,route_short_name,route_long_name,route_desc,route_type,route_url,route_color,route_text_color
100275,1,"8","","Seattle Center - Capitol Hill - Rainier Beach",3,https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/routes-and-service/schedules-and-maps/008.html,,
```

An individual trip, meaning a scheduled run of a single bus on that route, is represented by a
unique `trip_id` value found in `trips.txt`. A unique `trip_id` is generated, I believe, for
every combination of `route_id`, `service_id`, and `direction_id`. Where `service_id` represents
the schedule e.g `Weekday` vs `Weekend` and `direction_id` represents `inbound` vs `outbound`.

```
route_id,service_id,trip_id,trip_headsign,trip_short_name,direction_id,block_id,shape_id,peak_flag,fare_id,wheelchair_accessible,bikes_allowed
100275,3105,572987776,"Seattle Center","LOCAL",0,7331487,31008004,0,101,1,1
100275,18192,599398116,"Mount Baker Transit Center","LOCAL",1,7331728,40008003,0,101,1,1
```

## Example Analysis: Jupytr Notebook

I first started to play with these data using a Jupytr Notebook, which I've posted to github here: [https://github.com/mattmakesmaps/gtfs-exploration/blob/main/notebooks/kc_metro/data-exploration-and-mapping.ipynb](https://github.com/mattmakesmaps/gtfs-exploration/blob/main/notebooks/kc_metro/data-exploration-and-mapping.ipynb)

I wanted to answer some basic questions such as:
- Try to find all stops for a given route.
- Visualize all stops for a given route as a map.
- Visualize frequency of trips by hour for a given route and service
  (e.g weekday vs weekend.)

With regards to the later question for example, it was fun to see how service levels
didn't decrease all that much on the weekend for Route 8. Weekday vs Weekend,
it looks like the major difference are a few extra weekday trips during rush hour
in the mornings and afternoons.
