# Hello

Hello 👋 - My name is Matt Kenny, and I’m interested in mapping technologies,
woodworking, and growing with my amazing wife and twin sons.

I’m taking time off work to recover after caring for my mom through
brain cancer, dementia, and hospice.

I most recently spent nine years as an engineer on the Maps team
at **[Tableau Software](https://www.tableau.com/)** in Seattle, WA.

Prior to that, I worked as a cartographer and Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) analyst working with Tribal governments in Washington, Oregon,
Alaska, and the American Southwest at **[RIDOLFI](https://www.ridolfi.com/)**.

Feel free to say "hello" with any of the following socials:

Below are some woodworking projects from the pandemic era forward.
I rely mainly on powertools like my Sawstop contractor saw and
x-carve CNC machine. I use Autodesk Fusion 360 for design work,
and generating toolpaths for the CNC.
